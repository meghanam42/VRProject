# VR Project

## Installation and Usage
To start the game you must first plug in the oculus headset and make sure that the oculus link is active and that the 2 controllers are active. 
Then in the project there will be 2 folders and in the "protest simulation build" folder there will be an executable file called "BLM simulation.exe" that you can double click 
to run.

For the usage of the game, 

regarding movement we have implemented a teleportation system, where the user can push the right joystick in the direction you want to face after aiming the controller 
then you can let go of the joystick to teleport. you can also turn 45 degreees using the left joystick.

To start the simulation point and click the start button using A
this will also be shown in the start menu tutorial with images.

## System Requirements
Oculus Rift/Quest with Joystick controller will be needed as the functionality within the game needs access to the 'A' button on this joystick. We will provide this to the user when doing user testing.

## General Functionality
The general functionality of this simulation is as follows:
* Simulation starts with a voice over and a basic tutorial on how to traverse the simulation
* Allow the user to teleport to specific parts of the VR simulation where they can move around and experience what is happening around them in terms of dialogue and characters. 
* As they teleport the audio and characters will move with them - different teleport points will have different incidents and different dialogue and interaction going on.
* Simulation ends with speech

## Differences to inital project plan
There are not that many differences to our intial project plan, and we have predominantly stuck with our original aim of taking the user slowly through what a protest would look like, having a protestor within the environemnt talking directly with the user/player so that they feel more immersed and invovled within the protest.
