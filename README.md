# VR Project

## Installation and Usage

## System Requirements
Oculus Rift/Quest with Joystick controller will be needed as the functionality within the game needs access to the 'A' button on this joystick. We will provide this to the user when doing user testing.

## General Functionality
The general functionality of this simulation is as follows:
* Simulation starts with a voice over and a basic tutorial on how to traverse the simulation
* Allow the user to teleport to specific parts of the VR simulation where they can move around and experience what is happening around them in terms of dialogue and characters. 
* As they teleport the audio and characters will move with them - different teleport points will have different incidents and different dialogue and interaction going on.
* Simulation ends with speech

## Differences to inital project plan
There are not that many differences to our intial project plan, and we have predominantly stuck with our original aim of taking the user slowly through what a protest would look like, having a protestor within the environemnt talking directly with the user/player so that they feel more immersed and invovled within the protest.
